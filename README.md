<a id="usage"></a>

## Usage

### Render Payment Modal
There are two types of modal that can be rendered, the inline modal and the standard modal. The inline modal is rendered on your website while the standard modal is rendered on a flutterwave hosted page.

## Inline Modal
```php
$payload = [
    "tx_ref" => "MC-".time(),
    "amount" => 100,
    "currency" => Currency::NGN,
    "customer" => [
        "email" => "olaobajua@gmail.com"
    ],
];


$service = new Flutterwave\Payments\Flutterwave();

if (! isset($payload['tx_ref'])) {
    $payload['tx_ref'] = $service->generateTransactionReference();
}

$payment_details = $service->render('inline', $payload);

return view('flutterwave::modal', compact('payment_details'));

```

## Standard Modal
```php
$service = new Flutterwave\Payments\Flutterwave();

if (! isset($payload['tx_ref'])) {
    $payload['tx_ref'] = $service->generateTransactionReference();
}

$payment_link = $service->render('standard', $payload);

return redirect($payment_link);

```

## Testing

All of the SDK's tests are written with PHP's ```phpunit``` module. The tests currently test:
```Modals```,
```Webhooks```,
```Transactions```,

They can be run like so:

```sh
phpunit
```

>**NOTE:** If the test fails for creating a subaccount, just change the ```account_number``` ```account_bank```  and ```businesss_email``` to something different

>**NOTE:** The test may fail for account validation - ``` Pending OTP validation``` depending on whether the service is down or not
